# TODO: Enhance Login and Register Pages

## Steps to Complete

- [x] Create new Register.jsx component with unique styling, client-side validation, animations, and themed elements (using rose.png).
- [x] Update Login.jsx to remove toggle functionality, focus on login only, and add enhanced styling, validation, animations, and themed elements.
- [x] Update App.jsx to add a new /register route pointing to the Register component.
- [ ] Run the frontend development server to test the changes.
- [ ] Use browser_action to launch and verify the login and register pages for responsiveness, functionality, and visual appeal.
- [ ] If any issues, debug frontend code only (no backend changes).
